Introduction – Why We Chose This Project

Agriculture in India largely depends on rainfall, especially the monsoon season. Variations in rainfall patterns directly affect crop yield, irrigation planning, and farmers’ income. However, understanding rainfall trends manually from large datasets is difficult. Therefore, this project, “Exploratory Analysis of Rainfall Data in India for Agriculture,” was chosen to analyze historical rainfall data, identify patterns, and provide meaningful insights that can support better agricultural planning and decision-making. The project helps in understanding drought-prone and high-rainfall regions and forms a base for future rainfall prediction systems.

Technologies Used (Brief)

Python: Used for data processing, analysis, and implementation.

Pandas & NumPy: For data cleaning, handling missing values, and statistical analysis.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualization of rainfall trends using charts and graphs.

Jupyter Notebook: Development environment for running analysis and displaying results.

Machine Learning Libraries (Scikit-learn): Used for basic predictive analysis where required.
